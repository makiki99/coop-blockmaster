# coop-blockmaster

This repository is set as a repository for an university project.

This will be a simple block stacking game played cooperatively, inspired by Tetris The Grand Master 2's Doubles mode (see: https://youtu.be/vepqWSQxHe8). The goal stays the same as in the single-player variant - to clear lines and survive until the end. One of the things to note is that the blocks may collide with each other. We will want to support up to four players playing at once on a single board.
